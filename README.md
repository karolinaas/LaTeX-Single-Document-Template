# LaTeX Single Document Template

Template repository for building and publishing simple LaTeX documents to github pages. Forked from [matejpopda/LaTeX-Notes-Template](https://github.com/matejpopda/LaTeX-Notes-Template) and adapted for my personal needs.

To enable the github pages, go to your repo settings/pages and in build and deployment select the from actions option.

.gitignore is configured to ignore all files (including pdfs) those get deployed to github pages, and uploaded as an artifact with the workflow in the .github folder.
